> ### NOTE
>
> The Framework still in development stage. <br />
> Documentation is still in-progress.
>
> The Framework based on some CodeStar Framework, MetaBox.io code and design. The fields configs desgin also based on CodeStar Framework.
I created this framework for plugins and metaboxes. Not for Themes. For Themes I recommend CodeStar Framework.

### IMPORTANT
* As 2018-09-11 we have a new hooks name to meet WordPress standards.
* After multilanguage compatibility the <b>options array did changed.</b><br>
from `unique[field-id]` to `unique[current_lang][field-id]` where:<br>
if multilang plugin installed, then the selected language, otherwise WordPress installed language.

The Framework is fully functional (accoding our tests) but the refactoring not yet done, some changes will come.

### DESCRIPTION

WHY?
I need someting fast, easy and lightweight to generate option page and/or metabox for my plugins and/or post types.

I also love to create/code to have fun and leary every day someting new.

For my theme I use CodeStar Framework, so I created similarly. Unfortunately CodeStar Framework based on static class, can not initialize multiple times and this is required for plugns.

#### Lightweight

No ads, Files are loaded only when required. Minimum footprint.

#### Integration

Easy to integrate with any plugin or post type (even WordPress theme, but it is not designed to do so).

#### Open Source

Exopite Simple Options is free and available on Github. Feel free to submit patches or add more features.

### FEATURES

- Easy field generator for plugin options for metabox for any post type.
- All field support callback on default value, content callback for content and notice field.
- Dependency handling, also for section tabs (only in tabbed=true).
- No ads, and never will.
- Files are loaded only when required.
- Minimum footprint.
- Multilang support for WPML, Polylang, WP Multilang and qTranslate-X.
- Availability to save post meta as simple (each setting has it's own custom field) istead of an array.

#### Why did we add options to save meta as "simple"
Simple options is stored az induvidual meta key, value pair, otherwise it is stored in an array.

I implemented this option because it is possible to search in serialized (array) post meta:
- https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/16709/meta-query-with-meta-values-as-serialize-arrays
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15056407/wordpress-search-serialized-meta-data-with-custom-query
- https://www.simonbattersby.com/blog/2013/03/querying-wordpress-serialized-custom-post-data/

but there is no way to sort them with wp_query or SQL.

https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/87265/order-by-meta-value-serialized-array/87268#87268<br>

It is possible to get all required posts and store them in an array and then sort them as an array, but what if you want
multiple keys/value pair to be sorted?

UPDATE<br>
it is maybe possible:<br>
http://www.russellengland.com/2012/07/how-to-unserialize-data-using-mysql.html<br>
but it is waaay more complicated and less documented as meta query sort and search.
It should be not an excuse to use it, but it is not as reliable as it should be.

```

##### Get options:
* for "menu" use:
Eg.:
```php
$my_options = get_option('my-plugin-slug');
if ( $my_options[$current_lang]['my-option-name'] ) {
    // code...
}
```
You can check if you get the right options with:
```php
var_export( $my_options, true );
```

* for "meta" use:
```php
$my_meta_options = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'my-plugin-slug', true ); // array
// -- OR as simple --
$my_meta_options = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'my-option-name', true ); // as single, type mixed
```
